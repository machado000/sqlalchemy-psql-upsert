and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.2] - 2025-08-28

### Fixed
- **Type Checking Errors**: Fixed all mypy errors in test files with proper type annotations
- **DataFrame Ambiguity Error**: Fixed "The truth value of a DataFrame is ambiguous" error by replacing problematic `or` usage with explicit None checks
- **Return Type Annotations**: Enhanced return type hints for better type safety and IDE support

### Changed
- **Test Type Safety**: Added comprehensive type annotations to all test functions and fixtures
- **Code Quality**: Improved type checking compliance across the entire codebase

## [1.2.0] - 2025-07-27

### Added
- **Python 3.10+ Required**: Dropped support for Python 3.9, now requires Python 3.10 or newer.
- **PEP 561 Typing Support**: Added `py.typed` marker and modern type hints throughout the codebase.
- **Strict Type Checking**: CI now enforces strict type checking with mypy on every commit and pull request.
- **Improved Documentation**: Updated README and docstrings for clarity, modern usage, and PyPI polish.
- **CI Improvements**: GitHub Actions workflow now tests across Python 3.10â€“3.13, runs mypy, pytest, and syntax checks.

### Changed
- **README**: Removed outdated references to CTE-based logic, clarified temporary table + MERGE architecture, and modernized feature list.
- **Type Hints**: Upgraded all type hints to Python 3.10+ syntax (e.g., `list[str]`, `tuple[str, str]`).
- **Project Structure**: Moved typing validation script to `tests/` for better organization.

### Fixed
- **Type Checking Errors**: Fixed all mypy errors and ensured 100% type coverage.

## [1.1.0]

### Changed
- **Major Architecture Update**: Replaced chunked multi-threaded approach with temporary table + CTE-based MERGE operations
- **Improved Type Hints**: Enhanced type annotations throughout the codebase for better IDE support and static analysis
- **Enhanced Docstrings**: Comprehensive documentation updates with better parameter descriptions and return type documentation

### Technical Improvements
- **Temporary Table Approach**: Uses PostgreSQL temporary tables for staging data before conflict resolution
- **Advanced CTE Logic**: Sophisticated Common Table Expression (CTE) queries for conflict analysis and deduplication
- **Single Transaction Operations**: Entire upsert operation now happens in a single transaction for better consistency
- **Atomic MERGE Operations**: Uses PostgreSQL 15+ MERGE statement for atomic upsert operations

### Removed
- **Multi-threading Support**: Removed chunk-based parallel processing in favor of more reliable single-transaction approach
- **Chunk Size Configuration**: No longer needed with temporary table approach
- **Worker Count Configuration**: Removed due to single-threaded design

## [1.0.3] - Previous Release

### Added
- **Automatic NaN to NULL conversion**: All pandas NaN values (np.nan, pd.NaType, None) are now automatically converted to PostgreSQL NULL values during upsert operations
- **Improved data integrity**: Better handling of missing/null data in DataFrames

### Features
- Multi-constraint conflict detection: Automatically handles primary key, unique constraints, and composite constraints
- Smart conflict filtering: Removes rows that would conflict with multiple existing records
- Automatic NaN to NULL conversion: Seamlessly converts pandas NaN values to PostgreSQL NULL values
- Multi-threaded processing: Parallel chunk processing for large datasets
- Configurable batch sizes: Optimize memory usage and processing speed
- Schema validation: Automatic table and column validation before operations
- Comprehensive error handling: Detailed logging and error reporting
